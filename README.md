# Easy Logshark for MacOS

## Prerequisites 
### Git
Try to run this command in terminal: 
```
git
```
If you already have it installed, you should see output like this:
```
(base) âžœ  ~ git                                                         
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
           <command> [<args>]
```
If you don't have it installed, you wil be prompted to install developer tools.

Install the developer tools, so git and other command line tools are installed.

NOTE: This can take a while to install.
In the meantime you can proceed installing Docker

### Docker
1. Go to https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/ to download the appropriate installer
2. Install the application
3. Make sure docker is running by checking if this icon is present:

NOTE: Docker does not run on startup and is required for Logshark.
You can set it to run on startup in the General settings

## Setting up

Open terminal:

The default install location is: <b>/home/yourusername/logshark</b>

If you want to change the install location, go to the alternative directory using "cd":

```
  #Example:
  cd ~/Documents
```
Now you are ready to copy the required files from this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/dylanwijman/logshark.git
```
Open Finder and go to you install location (/home/yourusername/logshark) and run <b>setup.command</b> by double clicking.

This will:
- Create input, output and log directories
- Make a copy of the official Logshark repository (https://github.com/tableau/Logshark)
- Create an image that can process Tableau logfile archieves

The terminal window can be closed after running

## Running Logshark
- Put <b>a single</b> .zip logfile in the input directory
- <b>Optional</b>: Apply configuration changes to LogSharkConfig.json as needed
- Then double-click the RUN.command file to process
- Find the resulting workbooks in the output directory
  
Default location of the input directory is: <b>/home/yourusername/logshark/input/ </b>
  
Default location of the output directory is: <b>/home/yourusername/logshark/output/ </b>
